　　I am currently a professor with the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. I received my Bachelor Degree in Environmental Science and Engineering in 2006 and Master degree in Control Science and Engineering in 2009, both from Hunan University in Changsha, China. I received the Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2014. From 2014-2016, I worked as a Senior Research Associate on computer vision in the School of Computer Science, University of Adelaide, Australia. My research interests include machine learning, sparse analysis, deep learning and large-scale optimization.
